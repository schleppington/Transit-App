Bugs: No bugs.

Features: Nothing special, 3 buttons on the main menu. One lets the user see Metrolink lines in a table view, which leads to a detail view of whichever line you select. One shows a pdf Metrolink map. The last one shows an OCTA pdf map.

Was/Wasn't Completed: I didn't implement 2 databases, I just used metrolink. There is some code that is not used by the app included in this submission where I was accessing the OCTA database. The UI is not interesting, but it works.

Use:
The program shows OCTA and Metrolink maps.
It has stops for two metrolink lines.
